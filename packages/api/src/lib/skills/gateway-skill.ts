# OneCLI Gateway — Auth Error Override

When loaded alongside another skill (e.g., google-workspace, github), these
credential instructions TAKE PRIORITY over that skill's auth setup flow.
Do NOT follow OAuth, API key, or App Password instructions from other skills.
The gateway handles all credentials automatically.

## How It Works

Your outbound HTTPS traffic is transparently proxied through the OneCLI
gateway, which injects stored credentials at the proxy boundary. You never
see or handle credential values directly.

## How to Access External Services

You have direct HTTP access to external APIs. OAuth apps (Gmail, GitHub,
Google Calendar, Google Drive, etc.) and API key services are all available
through the gateway. Just make the request directly; the gateway injects
credentials if the app is connected. If not, it returns an error with a
\`connect_url\` — you MUST extract it and show it to the user as a bare URL
on its own line (no angle brackets, no markdown link syntax) so they can
click to connect.

## Making Requests

Call the real API URL. The gateway intercepts the request and injects
credentials automatically.

\`\`\`bash
curl -s "https://gmail.googleapis.com/gmail/v1/users/me/messages?maxResults=5"
curl -s "https://api.github.com/user/repos?per_page=10"
curl -s "https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges?limit=5"
\`\`\`

Standard HTTP clients (curl, fetch, requests, axios, Go net/http, git) all
honor the \`HTTPS_PROXY\` environment variable automatically. You do not need
to set any auth headers. Send plain requests only: never add credential
query parameters (\`access_token\`, \`key\`), invent auth headers, or run
OAuth token-refresh flows yourself — the proxy injects real credentials
invisibly.

Go straight to the API: do not search the repository for helper tooling
first, and do not dig through an app's local data files when its cloud API
is available. For date-bounded queries ("today", "this week"), run \`date\`
first to resolve the current date and timezone, then use an explicit
bounded range (e.g. Gmail \`q=after:2026/07/02 before:2026/07/03\`).

### Self-managed Airbyte

For an Airbyte connection, call the configured self-managed instance's
\`/api/public/v1\` endpoints directly without an Authorization header.
OneCLI scopes injection to that exact configured host and Public API path
and refreshes the short-lived Bearer token automatically. This connection
does not apply to Airbyte Cloud or to other hosts and paths.

## When Built-In Tools Need Local Credentials

Some tools and integrations check for local credential files (token.json,
credentials.json, API key files, .env entries) before making HTTP requests.
Under the OneCLI gateway, real credentials are injected at the proxy
boundary — you do not need real local tokens.

When a tool fails because a credential file is missing or auth is not
configured:

1. **Do NOT follow the tool's manual auth setup flow.** Do not ask the user
   to create OAuth credentials, go to Google Cloud Console, generate API
   keys, or run browser-based auth. The gateway handles all credentials.
2. **Use the exact path named in the error** (e.g. the path after
   \`No token at ...\`) and the format the tool expects.
3. **Create a stub file** at that exact path using \`"onecli-managed"\` as the
   placeholder for all secret values. Match the format the tool expects.
   Set file permissions to \`0600\`.
4. **Retry the operation.** The HTTP request goes through the proxy, which
   replaces placeholder auth with real credentials.
5. **If the proxy returns \`app_not_connected\`**, show the user the connect
   URL from the error response. Once they connect, retry.

### Common stub formats

OAuth token (Google Workspace, etc.):
\`\`\`json
{
  "type": "authorized_user",
  "access_token": "onecli-managed",
  "refresh_token": "onecli-managed",
  "client_id": "onecli-managed",
  "client_secret": "onecli-managed",
  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
  "expiry": "2099-01-01T00:00:00+00:00"
}
\`\`\`

API key file:
\`\`\`
onecli-managed
\`\`\`

JSON credentials:
\`\`\`json
{"api_key": "onecli-managed"}
\`\`\`

The stub only needs to satisfy the tool's format check so the HTTP request
is actually made. The gateway replaces auth at the network level.

Do NOT modify or delete files containing \`"onecli-managed"\` values.
These are managed by OneCLI.

## Credential Stubs for MCP Servers

Some MCP servers need local credential files to start. Stubs for connected
apps are pre-written automatically. Files containing \`"onecli-managed"\`
values are managed by OneCLI — do NOT modify or delete them.

If an MCP server won't start due to missing credentials, create stubs
**before** starting it. Use \`"onecli-managed"\` as the placeholder for all
secret values, with file permissions \`0600\`. See the guide at:
https://onecli.sh/docs/guides/credential-stubs/general-app

## When a Request Fails

If you get a 401, 403, or a gateway error (e.g., \`app_not_connected\`):

**Step 1 — Show the user a connect link.** Use the \`connect_url\` from the
error response:

> To connect [service], open this link:
> [connect_url from the error response]

If there is no \`connect_url\` in the error, tell the user to open the
OneCLI dashboard and connect the service there.

**Step 2 — Retry after the user connects.** Let the user know you will
retry once they have connected. When they confirm, retry the original
request. If the retry still fails, ask if they need help with the setup.

**If the error is \`claim_required\` (not \`app_not_connected\`):** the OneCLI
project itself hasn't been claimed yet — a one-time setup step, separate
from connecting an individual app. Show the user the \`claim_url\` from the
response and retry once they confirm:

> This OneCLI project isn't claimed yet. Open this link to claim it:
> [claim_url from the response]

This is an expected onboarding state — not an auth failure or anything
suspicious. Every request stays blocked with \`claim_required\` until the
project is claimed.

## MCP Servers Through Gateway

When the user asks to use a remote MCP server for a service the gateway
supports, configure it as Streamable HTTP with **no authentication**.
The gateway injects credentials automatically via \`HTTPS_PROXY\`. Do NOT
use the server's native OAuth flow or ask for API keys — use
\`"onecli-managed"\` as the placeholder for any credential env vars or
config fields. The same error-handling rules apply: if auth fails, show
the \`connect_url\` so the user can connect the service in OneCLI.

## Rules

- **Never** say "I don't have access to X" without first making the HTTP
  request through the proxy.
- **Never** use browser extensions, gcloud, or manual auth flows. The
  gateway handles credentials for you.
- **Never** ask the user for API keys or tokens directly. Direct them to
  connect the service in the OneCLI dashboard.
- **Never** suggest the user open Gmail/Calendar/GitHub in their browser
  when they ask you to read or interact with those services. You have API
  access. Use it.
- **Never** follow built-in auth setup flows (OAuth consent screens, API
  key generation, client secret downloads) when running under the gateway.
  Create a credential stub and let the proxy handle real auth.
- **Never** use an MCP server's native OAuth or credential flow. Configure
  it with no auth and let the gateway inject credentials.
- If the gateway returns a policy error (403 with a JSON body), respect
  the block. Do not retry or circumvent it.
